# Order Routing

## What is Order Routing?

Order routing allows the OMS to determine the best location to fulfill an order according to a set of criteria. The criteria are in respect to selecting which order (part of order) to broker and the criteria to find inventory.

## What is Configurable Order Routing?

Configurable routing brokers a set of orders to fulfill from a set of facilities. A brokering algorithm can have multiple, sequential, rule-sets with unique attributes and conditions which orders and facilities will be evaluated against. Deep customization of the brokering workflow allows retailers to implement real-time revisions to their routing parameters without any external support.

Retailers use configurable routing to create order fulfillment strategies best suited for their business. User configurable routing rules allow retailers to optimize fulfillment cost, inventory, and workload based on arbitrary order and fulfillment location parameters such as order total, SKUs, product category, facility type, operating hours, or fulfillment capacity.

For unfillable orders that did not meet routing criteria under any rule set, retailers can explicitly state what actions must be taken.

Let’s learn how to configure order routing in HotWax Commerce to enhance and optimize fulfillment operations with this user manual.

This guide will lead you through the process of configuring your brokering run, routings and rules to enhance and optimize your fulfillment operations. Before diving into the configuration steps, it's crucial to have a solid understanding of the various routing parameters.

Brokering rules play a pivotal role in your fulfillment strategy and are structured hierarchically:

Understanding this organizational structure is fundamental to efficiently configure and manage your brokering rules. Now, let's delve into each level in detail in the next sections.
