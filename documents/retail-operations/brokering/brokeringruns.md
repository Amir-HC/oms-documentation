# Brokering Runs

Runs in the brokering system act as containers for sequences of routings. These runs are scheduled by retailers to execute at specified intervals, allowing for effective and timely order routing.

### Viewing Brokering Runs

1. **Chronological Sequence**
   * Once logged in, you'll find all routing runs presented in a chronological sequence based on their next scheduled run time.

### Scheduling Brokering Runs

Brokering runs are scheduled using two essential parameters:

1. **Frequency**
   * Determine how often you want the brokering run to execute. Options include:
2. **Runtime**
   * Specify the time of day (in 24-hour format) when the brokering run should initiate.

For example, setting the frequency of a run to "Daily" and the runtime to "7 am" will execute the brokering run every morning at 7 am.

Understanding how to view, schedule, and manage brokering runs is essential for optimizing your order routing strategies.
