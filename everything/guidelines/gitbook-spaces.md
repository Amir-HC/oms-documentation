# Gitbook Space


The ability to create and manage spaces and collections within GitBook is essential for organizing and maintaining documentation. This feature allows users to structure their content efficiently, ensuring that related information is grouped logically. For users who need to manage extensive documentation, such as developers, technical writers, and project managers, this feature is crucial. It ensures that their work is well-organized, easily accessible, and synchronized with source code repositories like GitHub, enhancing workflow efficiency.

### Step-by-Step Usage Instructions

1. **Log in to your GitBook account:** Ensure you are logged into your GitBook account to access your documentation projects.

2. **View Existing Collections and Spaces:** In the left-hand menu, you will see all the existing collections and spaces within GitBook. This step allows you to understand the current structure and decide where new spaces or collections should be added.

3. **Add a New Space or Collection:** Click on the `Add` button next to "Spaces" for expanding your documentation by either creating new content areas (spaces) or grouping related spaces (collections).

4. **Create a Space:** Provide a `Title` for your new space. Start writing content by adding pages if you plan to create documentation directly within GitBook. 

5. **Configure GitHub Sync:** Click on the `Configure` button at the top right. Synchronizing with GitHub ensures that your documentation is always up-to-date with the latest changes in your codebase.

6. **Enable GitHub Sync:** Click on `GitHub Sync` or `Gitlab Sync` and confirm the action. Enabling synchronization ensures that your GitBook content is in sync with your GitHub or Gitlab repository.

7. **Authenticate GitHub Sync:** Select the space and click on `Connect with GitHub` to authenticate. This step links your GitHub account with GitBook, allowing for seamless integration.

8. **Specify Sync Path:** Add the correct path by selecting the `account`, `repository`, `branch`, and `directory` (if any). Use the format `./folder1/folder2` for directories. Ensuring the correct path is crucial for accurate synchronization of your content.

9. **Commit Message Template (Optional):** Select a template for commit messages or pull request reviews if required. Using a consistent template helps maintain clarity and uniformity in your version history.

10. **Select Sync Direction:** Choose whether you want to sync from `GitHub to Gitbook` (if you write content on GitHub) or from `Gitbook to GitHub` (if you write content on GitBook). This determines the direction of the synchronization process based on your workflow.

11. **Initiate Synchronization:** Click on `Sync` and wait for the synchronization to complete. This final step ensures that your documentation is synchronized and up-to-date.

12. **Verify Synced Pages:** The pages will appear as per the summary if you are syncing from `GitHub to GitBook`. Verifying the synchronized pages ensures that the content is accurately updated and organized.

13. **Share and Publish the Space:** Once the content is available on GitBook, click on the `Share` button. Sharing allows others to access your documentation, enhancing collaboration and information dissemination.

14. **Navigate to Publish to the Web:** Navigate to the `Publish to the Web` button and turn the toggle on for `Publish Space to the Web`. Publishing to the web makes your documentation publicly accessible.

16. **Customize and Save the URL:** A custom URL will appear, which you can change as per your preference and save the URL link. A customized URL ensures that your documentation is easily accessible and memorable for users.

17. **Access the Published Pages:** The GitHub pages will now appear on the web with the custom URL you set. This final step ensures that your documentation is publicly available and can be accessed by anyone with the URL.

By following these steps, users can efficiently create, manage, and publish their documentation within GitBook, ensuring a streamlined and organized workflow.
