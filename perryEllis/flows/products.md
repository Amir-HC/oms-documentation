# Products

**Perry Ellis International** relies on **Shopify** as its primary source of product information. **HotWax Commerce** imports product data from Shopify, synchronizing three distinct product catalogs representing the three brands: Perry Ellis, Cubavera, and Original Penguin. These brands are represented as separate product stores within the OMS.

**Key Points:**

* **Shopify as Data Source:** Shopify serves as the central repository for product information.
* **Three Product Catalogs:** HotWax synchronizes data from three distinct catalogs, each representing a specific brand.
* **Product Store Representation:** Each brand is represented as a separate product store within the OMS, facilitating management and organization.
* **SKU as Primary Identifier:** The `SKU` (Stock Keeping Unit) is used as the primary identifier to link products across the different catalogs.
