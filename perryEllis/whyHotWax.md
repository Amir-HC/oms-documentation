**Omnichannel Fulfillment:**

## Prior Initiatives

**Perry Ellis International** encountered difficulties with their **Shopify** integration when implementing a **Buy Online, Pick Up In Store (BOPIS)** strategy. The lack of specific **Shopify REST API calls** designed for marking orders as ready for customer pickup hindered their ability to provide a seamless BOPIS experience for customers.
