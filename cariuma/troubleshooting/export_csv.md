# Export CSV

Users need to extract sales order details from HotWax OMS for all or specific types of order by applying some filters. A dedicated <img src="./Icons/x-csv.png" alt="external link icon" width="12" height="12">`Export CSV` option can be used.

## Steps to Export CSV

**Open Hotwax Administrator App then,**

1. In the Hamburger menu, go to the `Order Management Section`.
2. Select `Sales Orders` from the available options.

**Ensure if there are existing orders before applying filters. To do this,**

1. Go to the OMS Administrator App and check if there are any `Sales Orders`.
   - If no sales orders are present, the exported CSV will be empty by default.
   - If orders are present, proceed with below steps

**Apply correct Filters**

1. On `Sales Order` page in Hotwax OMS, check selections like status and other filter checkboxes in the options bar to ensure the correct filters are applied before exporting. 
   - For instance, if you want to export only pre-orders details, locate and check the "`Pre-Orders`<img src="./Icons/check-box.png" alt="external link icon" width="12" height="12">" or "`Back Orders`<img src="./Icons/check-box.png" alt="external link icon" width="12" height="12">" checkbox as needed.

2. Click on the <img src="./Icons/x-csv.png" alt="external link icon" width="12" height="12">`Export CSV` option,then a CSV file will be downloaded.

**Note:** _The CSV export option is visible only if orders exist after applying filters._

## Troubleshooting Scenario

Sometimes, an issue might arise where the exported CSV file is empty. This could be due to the unavailability of orders or improper filter selections.

In such cases, ensure that orders are available on the `Sales Order` page before and after applying filters as needed. If sales orders exist and the exported CSV file is still empty, contact HotWax Commerce for further assistance. Provide them with details about the issue, any error messages received, and steps already taken to troubleshoot.
